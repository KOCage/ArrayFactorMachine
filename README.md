This solution is for a code challenge to implement the following:

Given an array of integers, calculate the factors in the array for each integer. Output them in whatever format, but basically group each integer with their factors. For example: Given [ 2, 3, 4, 6 ], the output would have {2: []},{4: [2]}, {6: [2, 3]}. 

For additional challenge, implement a caching system that will provide the answers to a given array without performing the calculation again.
